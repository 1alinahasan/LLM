# Text Classification Using LangChain  
**Enhancing Natural Language Understanding**

This project focuses on building an advanced and scalable text classification system using **LangChain** and state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). The goal is to improve contextual understanding, sentiment awareness, and classification accuracy across diverse text domains while maintaining scalability and privacy.

## Project Overview
The system leverages LangChain to orchestrate LLM-powered pipelines for text classification. By integrating transformer-based models such as **GPT-J**, **GPT-NeoX**, and **DialoGPT**, the project explores trade-offs between performance, computational cost, and deployment feasibility.

## Objectives
- Build a reliable and accurate text classification framework using LangChain  
- Enhance contextual and sentiment-level understanding of text  
- Design a scalable system deployable on both cloud and local environments  
- Promote open-source collaboration and reproducibility  

## Models Explored
- **GPT-J (6B)** – Strong contextual understanding, locally deployable  
- **GPT-NeoX (20B)** – High performance for complex language tasks, resource-intensive  
- **DialoGPT** – Optimized for conversational and dialogue-based text  

Each model was evaluated for suitability in classification tasks, adaptability, and computational requirements :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

## Technical Approach
- LangChain prompt templates for structured interaction  
- Conversation memory for context retention  
- Hugging Face pipelines for:
  - Text generation  
  - Sentiment analysis  
- Modular architecture to support future model extensions  

The implementation demonstrates how LLMs can be adapted from generation-focused tasks to classification workflows :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

## Key Focus Areas
- **Advanced NLP & AI methods**
- **Open-source foundation models**
- **Privacy-preserving techniques** (federated learning, differential privacy)
- **Scientific and domain-specific text processing**

## Application Domains
- **Healthcare & Cancer Research** – Classifying and summarizing medical literature  
- **Environmental & Climate Research** – Organizing policy documents and scientific reports  
- **Conversational AI** – Dialogue and sentiment-based classification  

## Results & Insights
- Demonstrated effective contextual and sentiment-aware classification  
- Highlighted strengths and limitations of generation-first LLMs for classification tasks  
- Validated LangChain as a flexible orchestration framework for NLP pipelines  

## Future Work
- Fine-tuning models specifically for classification tasks  
- Benchmarking against traditional classifiers (BERT, RoBERTa)  
- Scaling with distributed and privacy-preserving training  
- Deployment-ready APIs for real-time classification
